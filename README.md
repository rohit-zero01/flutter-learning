# Flutter Basics

This repository contains my Flutter learning and practice code.

I am using this project to practice core Flutter concepts such as:
- StatelessWidget and StatefulWidget  
- Layouts (Row, Column, Expanded, Container)  
- Buttons and gestures  
- ListView, GridView, ScrollView  
- TextField and input decoration  
- Basic state management using setState  

This repo represents my continuous learning journey in Flutter.
